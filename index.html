				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				<p> Decision-making in real-world multi-agent systems, especially where agent teams collaborate to
					compete while operating with full dynamics in changing environments and with imperfect opponent
					information, is an important and challenging problem that has many applications in next-generation
					robotics. The MAD-Games Multi-Agent Dynamic Games workshop at IROS aims to explore the latest
					advances in using game-theoretic and multi-agent learning approaches to help performant autonomous
					agents understand safe interaction with diverse competitive strategies. One of the key challenges in
					designing effective algorithms is handling the complex and highly interactive behavior between
					agents. Existing game theory models often rely on an oversimplified discretization of agent action
					spaces and strong assumptions such as perfect information and rational decision-making. These lead
					to inaccurate descriptions of the dynamics of real-world interactions. Additionally, the highly
					dynamic and unpredictable nature of real-world robotic systems can make it difficult to predict the
					behavior of the system, leading to safety risks. These dynamic games are inherently challenging as
					(a) crashing is dangerous and expensive, (b) Current sensors cannot infer the intention or strategy
					of the opponent, and (c) We are in a small-data regime as we cannot use past games to learn from as
					strategies, environments and vehicles change. The MAD Games workshop focuses on addressing these
					challenges by bringing together researchers and practitioners to (1) explore the latest developments
					in game theory for interactive decision-making with learning-enabled multi-agent systems, and (2)
					investigate how game-theoretic models can be adapted to handle the complexities of real-world
					robotic systems. </p>
				<!-- <p>In motorsport racing, there is a saying that “If everything seems under control, then you are not going fast enough”. Expert racing drivers have split second reaction times and routinely drive at the limits of control, traction, and agility of the racecar - under high-speed and close proximity situations. Autonomous racing presents unique opportunities and challenges in designing algorithms and hardware that can operate firmly on the limits of perception, planning, and control. Racing has a long and illustrative history of serving as a proving grounds for automotive technology. Similarly, autonomous racing has the potential to serve as the litmus test - but this time - for self-driving software. While a large portion of autonomous vehicle research and development is focused on handling routine driving situations, achieving the safety benefits of autonomous vehicles also requires a focus on driving at the limits of the control of the vehicle. </p> -->

				<!-- <p>The main objective of this workshop is to attract the interest of the robotics community on research challenges specific to high-speed autonomous racing. We aim at bringing together experts and researchers from various robotic fields explore the challenges associated with modeling vehicle dynamics at high-speeds, head-to-head multi-agent racing, AI-enabled racing solutions, sensor fusion, overtaking, state-estimation of opponents, racing simulation at scale, perception, localization, and planning. Autonomous racing competitions such as F1/10 Autonomous Racing, Roborace, and Indy Autonomous Challenge are encouraging researchers to think about these problems. We expect that this workshop will become the focal point for bringing together researchers from the growing autonomous racing and robotics communities to foster collaborative and creative solutions.</p> -->
